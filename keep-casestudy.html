                    allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents,
                    store images, link to websites, and collaborate with others. It is our job to help focus on the needs of the
                    user to meet their goals. Goals include easy navigation, user-friendly flow, and a minimal design all while
                    still being beautiful to look at. Structure, layout, and visual design play a huge part in creating this
                    successful web application.</p>

            <div class ="casestudyparagraph">
                <p>After creating wireframes in <b>Balsamiq</b>, I created high fidelity wireframes in <b>illustrator</b>. By creating wireframes in illustrator it gave me a better idea on where to put different colors, text, and contrast. </p>
                    <p>After the high fidelity wireframes, I created mockups in <b>Photoshop</b>. This step would give the final look as to how the website would look like. This is where the site logo was placed; Colors, typography, images, and links were optimized in this phase.</p>
                    <p>With the mockups finally created, I used Invision to see the exactly how the design would flow. I was able to use <b>Invision</b> to create user tests and see how different people would navigate through Keep. From the homepage, the user would click to the sign-up button,sign-in button, or any of the CTA buttons to navigate to the dashboard. From there the user can create notes, links, or upload images. The user also has the option to change settings. From the settings account, they can upgrade, or change their information. After watching a couple of users, I realized exactly where the users liked to click, where they gravitated to, and if they truly understood how the website worked.

                <p>In conclusion, I received great feedback to make Keep a user-friendly, simple web application for anyone to
                    use. Some ideas worked, while some ideas did not. I learned that it’s important to listen to users wants and
                    needs and keep my personal interests out of it. It’s important to do all the testing and research to really
                    understand what people want. When I tested my clickable prototype, it was amazing to compare industry
                    professionals to those who only use the internet for leisure. Both groups gave me ideas on how to better
                    the website for anyone and everyone. Receiving feedback from working industry professionals allowed me to
                    learn what is needed to attract advanced users. I learned to understand who the users were, what they wanted,
                    how to make a user-friendly flow, and on top of all that, how to properly include that in the final design.</p>
