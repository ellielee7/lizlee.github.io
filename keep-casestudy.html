                <p>Keep - a new startup that needs our help to design a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place.
                    A person can create simple documents, store images, link to websites, and collaborate with others. It is our job to help focus on the needs of the user to meet their goals
                    while making sure we meet the objectives and requirements of this project. Goals include easy navigation, user friendly flow, and a minimal design all while still being beautiful to look at. Structure, layout, and visual design play a huge part in creating this successful web application.</p>
                <p><b>Problem</b></p>
                    <p>Not having a space where users can easily save notes, links, and upload images.</p>

                <p>Create a web application where users can easily save content and share with others. The app must be easy to use, convenient, and can be accessed anywhere.</p>

                <p>After the survey, I did a competitive analysis to see how different companies position themselves, who their primary audience is, what user groups they are targeting, and what their key differentiators and features were. </p>

                <p>I used Invision to see exactly how the design would flow. I was able to create user tests and see how different people would navigate Keep. From the homepage, the user would click to either of the sign- up, sign-in, or COA buttons to navigate to the dashboard. From there the user can create notes, links, or upload images. The user also has to option to change settings. From the settings account, they can upgrade, or change their information. After watching a couple of user tests, I realized exactly where the users liked to click, where they gravitated to, and if they truly understood how the website worked.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, I received great feedback to make Keep a user-friendly, simple web application for anyone to use. Some ideas worked, while some ideas did not. I learned that it’s important to listen to what users wants and needs, rather than listening to what I wanted. It’s important to do all the testing  and research to really understand what people want. When I tested my clickable prototype, it was amazing to compare people who are in the industry and use the web on a daily basis to those who only use the internet for leisure. Both groups gave me ideas on how to better the website for anyone and everyone. Receiving feedback from working industry professionals allowed me to learn what is needed to attract advanced users. I learned to understand who the users were, what they wanted, how to make a user- friendly flow, and on top of all that, how to properly include that in the final design.</p>
