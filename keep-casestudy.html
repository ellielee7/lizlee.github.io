                <p>Keep - a new startup that needs our help to design a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others. It is our job to help focus on the needs of the user to meet their goals while making sure we meet the objectives and requirements of this project. Goals that include, easy navigation, making sure it is user friendly, and designing a web application that is visually minimal, but still beautiful to look at. Structure, layout, and visual design played a huge part in creating this successful web application.</p>

                <p> I used invision to see the exactly how the design would flow. I was able to use invision to create user tests and see how different people would navigate Keep. From the homepage, the user would click to the sign up button or sign in button, or any of the COA buttons to navigate to the dashboard. From there the user can create notes, links, or upload images. The user also has to option to change settings. From the setting account, they can upgrade, or change their information. After watching a couple of users, I realized exactly where the user like to click, where they gravitate to, and if they truly understand how the website works.</p>

In conclusion, I received some great feedback to make Keep a user friendly, simply web application for anyone to use. Some ideas worked, while some ideas did not. I learned that it’s important to listen to what the users want and need, rather than listening to what I want. It’s important to do all the testing  and research to really understand what people want. When I tested my clickable prototype, it was really amazing to watch people who are in the industry who uses the web on a daily basis, compared to those who only use the internet for leisure. Both groups gave me ideas on how to better the website for anyone and everyone. While, the people who are in the industry wanted more options, like collaborations, it allowed me to learn what is needed to attract the more advanced users. I definitely had doubts about this project because I wasn’t sure how to approach something like this.  I really needed to learn who the users are, what they want, what is most important, how to make a user friendly flow, and on top of all that, design. But in the end I learned so much. I can definitely use this information for all of my future projects.</p>
