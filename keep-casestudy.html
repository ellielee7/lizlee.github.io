                <p>Keep - a new startup that needs our help to design a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which
                    allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents,
                    store images, link to websites, and collaborate with others. It is our job to help focus on the needs of the
                    user to meet their goals. Goals include easy navigation, user-friendly flow, and a minimal design all while
                    still being beautiful to look at. Structure, layout, and visual design play a huge part in creating this
                    successful web application.</p>

                <p>I used Invision to see exactly how the design would flow. I was able to create user tests and see how different people would navigate through Keep.
                    From the homepage, the user would click to either of the sign-up, sign-in, or CTA buttons to land at the dashboard. From there the user can create notes,
                    links, or upload images. The user also has the option to change settings. From the settings account, they can upgrade, or change their personal information.
                    After watching a couple of user tests, I realized exactly where the users liked to click, where they gravitated to, and if they truly understood how the website worked. </p>

                <p>In conclusion, I received great feedback to make Keep a user-friendly, simple web application for anyone to
                    use. Some ideas worked, while some ideas did not. I learned that it’s important to listen to users wants and
                    needs and keep my personal interests out of it. It’s important to do all the testing and research to really
                    understand what people want. When I tested my clickable prototype, it was amazing to compare industry
                    professionals to those who only use the internet for leisure. Both groups gave me ideas on how to better
                    the website for anyone and everyone. Receiving feedback from working industry professionals allowed me to
                    learn what is needed to attract advanced users. I learned to understand who the users were, what they wanted,
                    how to make a user-friendly flow, and on top of all that, how to properly include that in the final design.</p>
