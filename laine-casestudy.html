                <p>After the survey, I picked three potential users and asked them more in depth questions about what they wanted in an e-commerce store.
                I was able to see what their specific goals were when it came to shopping online for home goods, furniture, and the like.
                Most users wanted to have items curated for them. May it be similar items from their previous orders, items that they reviewed or had as their favorite.
                By simply signing in, they would have options built just for them. </p>

                <p>While there are many competitors out there who specialize in home goods, I wanted to focus on
                    three that I believe would be the most comparable to Laine. <b>Anthropologie</b>, <b>Leif</b>, and <b>Poketo</b> stood out amongst the crowd. All three companies position themselves as unique, vintage-inspired, design-heavy homegood stores that are geared towards the 25-45 year-old creative demographic.

                    <p>Before getting into wireframes and designing a paper prototype of the website, I had to figure out the user flow first.

I focused on how to make the checkout experience straightforward and effortless all while optimizing sales.

                    <p>After creating multiple user flows and sketches, I was ready to create low-fidelity wireframes in <b>Balsamiq</b>. For the homepage, I wanted to see where I would add CTA buttons to allow users to search for things they might like. I did a couple of iterations where I centered the CTA buttons, and some that were either right or left aligned. For most users, the center had the most successful click-through rate. I also needed to figure out the sign-in process for new and returning users. I needed to make sure that it was simple and accessed within a couple of clicks; Filling in very few inputs, shoppers could be in and out when it came to shopping at Laine.

                <p>For the logo, I wanted to do calligraphy or hand lettering. I envisioned a minimal, modern look, similar to that of the products being sold.. I started off with a couple of sketches, most of which were cursive, calligraphy typography. Afterwards, I  researched possible fonts I could utilize. Ultimately, I decided to use a font as the base, but gave it character by tightening the letters, and giving it some depth.</p>
                <p>I was inspired by dusty rose as the main color palette for Laine. It has the rustic yet minimal feel that I believe Laine best represents. With this color palette in mind, I wanted keep it consistent with muted grays and pops of black and white allowing the product to really shine, and making the website as a whole feel comforting.</p>
