                <p>I first created a survey to see what users were missing when they shopped online. I wanted to create an e-commerce website that is super simple to use but also designed to showcase the product in the most elegant and minimal way.</p>
                <p>After the initial survey came the competitive and SWOT analysis to get a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t when it comes to online retail shopping.</p>
                <p>By interviewing potential users, I was able to see what their specific goals were when it came to shopping online for home goods, furniture, and the like.</p>

                    I made adjustments on how to make the site flow better and took every comment and piece of

                        took notes on where the user navigated to and how they got there. I gained insight on what the difficulties were and ultimately what the user thought of the product. </p>

                <p>Overall, I learned how important alignment is to make sure a website looks clean and organized. I have a better understanding of
                E-commerce and the importance of CTA buttons, above the fold placement of images, and making sure users can checkout with the least amount of inputs and making sure they feel protected and safe that they are purchasing from a valid website. I also learned how important user testing is to make
                sure you have a viable product that consumers would want to use. </p>
