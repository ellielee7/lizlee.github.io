                <p><b>Why?</b></p>
                    <p>Working as a cheesemonger for many years, one of the questions I always received was,
                        “I want to create a cheese plate, what should I put on it?”
                        After hearing this question hundreds of times I realized how an application like this
                        would be beneficial for people who love to entertain and want to put out a delicious cheese
                        plate but have no idea how to do it. Why be a cheesemonger for a single store when you can
                        do it for the entire online community. I wanted to create something simple, quick, and fun to use,
                        but also, create an experience that is not intimidating or pretentious.

                    be interested. After receiving positive responses, I created another survey
                    with questions that were geared towards understanding what cheese enthusiasts,
                    cheese club members, and people who love to entertain would want and need in an app. </p>

                <p>	One of the difficulties I encountered was trying to figure out what the MVP was and what could be added in the second phase. I ultimately decided to creat this app for people who are what you call cheese “newbies”. Those who like cheese but don’t know too much about it.
                    I wanted to create a quiz to figure out what the best cheese plate would be for that user and the occasion.

                <p>	From the beginning, I knew I wanted Cheese Block to be fun, and colorful.
                    Minimal design, shapes, and color would define the app.The questions needed
                    to keep users engaged, making sure that they finished the quiz without feeling
                    bored. Adding icons and illustrations gave it a playful vibe. The abstract shapes
                    were inspired from different types of cheeses. For example, the red circle represents
                    gouda, the yellow triangle is a wedge of cheese, and the teal block, is a cheese block,hence the name.
                    The results page is a clean, simple design for users to quickly receive their cheese suggestions.
                    The app  gives them exactly what cheese to buy at their local cheese shop, and if they can’t find
                    that particular cheese, they can skip and choose the next best cheese.  </p>

                <p>Cheese Block has definitely been a journey. I have gone through multiple designs, prototypes, mockups and testing. From the very beginning I had the idea of giving users the opportunity to participate by answering a
                    couple of questions and in the end feeling like they were being heard and providing them the results that best fit their interests. I wanted to make sure my years of experience as a cheesemonger didn’t go in vain and that I could help people by sharing my knowledge. After Cheese Block I realized it was so much easier said than done. There were so many moving parts I needed to figure out such as the result page, the questions, the sign up page, and the feel of the whole app. What did I want my branding to be? After so many preference tests and asking potential users what they preferred I was able to create a mock up that best represented what Cheese Block would be all about. I honestly learned so much from this project. In order to have a successful mobile app, you must test, test, test. After creating wireframes, sketches, mockups, test. Ask your friends, potentials users, classmates, get any feedback you can. Also, alignment. Alignment, hierarchy and typography are all important components when it comes to mobile apps. I also had to adhere to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines. It’s important to know what animation you’ll be using when building an app.</p>

                 <p>Overall, I loved creating something I truly believe in. I have always wanted to build an app like this and I am so glad I went for it and kept creating even when there was no end in sight. I know I still have some ways to go, but as long as I keep learning and building I think Cheese Block will be an amazing mobile application!</p>
