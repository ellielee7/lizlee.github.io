                    <p>I worked with the marketing team to find out who exactly were the competitors and took inspiration on their overview page. I wanted to see what they were doing, what patterns that arised, the pros, the cons, and the story.
                        What were they doing that was working and what could be fixed. That gave me more of a clear idea of how to approach our overview page. I then took inspiration from other websites. I seeked out those that had a clean, seamless
                        experience that I might be able to utilize in the new redesign.</p>

                        next low fidelity wireframes that I created in sketch. I wanted to play around with placement, layouts, copy and icons. I then presented
                        the multiple iterations that I created to my director and lead UX designers and settled on two different designs. I then created a high fidelity version of those wireframes and created a prototype on Invision.</p>

                    <p>Once I got a working prototype I was able to start usertesting. I used usertesting.com to create remote, unmoderated tests to see how the participants interacted with the design of the wireframes. We tested about six participants all who were starting a business in the next few months and were forming a incorporation
                        for their business. Most of the feedback were quite positive in which we were able to learn a lot about what revisions needed to be done.
